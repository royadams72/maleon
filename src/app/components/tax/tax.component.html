      We at Ma’Leon and Co can assist you in setting up a VAT scheme that will suit your business. You can either register voluntarily or <em>register once the threshold is reached (see below).</em>
      We can help you by calculating the VAT that needs to be paid or the amount to be refunded by HMRC from the goods or services that you buy and sell.
      <em>The threshold for VAT is £85,000</em> from April 2017 and you need to register for VAT if this threshold is reached. The deregistration limit is £83,000.
      There are a few schemes available such as cash accounting and flat scheme rate (that has now changed from 1st April 2017) and if you would like further information contact us at Ma’Leon and Co.</p>

      <em>The tax year runs from 6th April to 5th April (e.g. 6th April 2016 to 5th April 2017).</em> The ultimate deadline for filing and paying tax returns is Midnight 31st January the following year after that tax year (e.g. 31st January 2018).
      Here are some examples of when tax returns are required to be filed with HMRC if in the last tax year: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>you were self-employed - you can deduct allowable expenses</li>
        <li>you made profits from selling things like shares, a second home or other assets and need to pay <a href="#capital-gains-tax">Capital Gains Tax</a></li>
        <li>you were a company director - unless it was for a non-profit organisation (eg a charity) and you didn’t get any pay or benefits, like a company car</li>
        <li>you had income from abroad that you needed to pay tax on</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>If a tax return is just one day late, HMRC will impose an immediate penalty of £100.</em> The later the tax return, the more penalties (and interest). For current penalties <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/penalties" target="_blank">(see Gov.uk)</a>

        All companies now pay the tax of 20% irrespective of the level of profits. Previously larger companies were paying a higher tax rate. This rate will drop each year until 1st April 2020 where it will be at 17% - according to the last government budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your corporation tax must be paid within 9 months and 1 day of the end of year accounts</em> for smaller companies. For larger companies with profits over £1.5 million, corporation tax must be paid in quarterly instalments.
        And of course there are penalties for filing late, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/company-tax-returns/penalties-for-late-filing" target="_blank">see here.</a>
        </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ma’Leon and Co will work out your tax liability,</em> tell you when to pay your tax without getting a penalty and file your business accounts with both Companies House and HMRC within the specified deadlines.
        Corporation tax can be complex especially with contractors and the IR35 regime and the incoming government initiative ‘Making Tax Digital’.

          <p><span class="head1">Capital Gains Tax</span> – Is a tax on the profit of the item when you sell or dispose of an asset
          You are taxed on the gain you make and not the amount of money you receive for the item.
          Disposing of an asset is when you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sell it</li>
            <li>Give it away as a gift</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            And even on buy-to-let properties and land, capital gains tax has to be paid if you make a profit.
          </p>
          <p>
          You get a tax free allowance (annual exemption) just like your personal income tax – <a href="https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax/allowances" target="_blank">see here.</a>
