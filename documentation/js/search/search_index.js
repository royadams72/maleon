Internal factors, for example could be additional staff required causing more expenses to be        paid out, hence, increasing the budget.        External factors, could be the price rise in oil which has a knock on effect for petrol costs.                    This procedure is used to acknowledge any activity in your business that was        unforeseen when the budget was first set and which may now have an impact on your business.                    Ma’Leon Accountancy Services Limited are able to produce a forecast for you and this may        be performed/reviewed monthly, quarterly or half yearly depending on how        large or complex your business is.            Contact us                                    Management Accounting – Allows you to examine and observe trends within            your business and make important business decisions based on the information.                                You will be able to compare your budget and/or forecast figures that you set at            the beginning of the year for income and expenditure against your            actual results enabling you to see the difference between the both in a summarised form.                                  This report can be produced monthly, quarterly or half yearly depending on your individual needs.                                Ma’Leon Accountancy Services Limited can compile a brief commentary and graphical charts for inclusion in            the report to assist in the deciphering and detail of your actual results.            This will enable you to have a better            understanding of your accounts, how you have performed and make proficient business decisions.                                Also, at your request, Ma’Leon Accountancy Services Limited can also extend the management accounts report            into a management accounts pack that contains            more financial and non-financial information.            These packs may vary but would mainly consist of an income statement            (profit and loss account) and a balance sheet (assets and liabilities).                              Contact us for more information.                                    Payroll - The calculation of the net pay due to employees      after taking into account all deductions and reimbursement of expenses.                    Ultimately the primary function of a payroll is to ensure that accurate regular agreed payments are calculated        for each employee and to correctly calculate any tax and national        insurance deductions that may occur within the same given time frame.                    Payroll encompasses the payment of staff; whether they are part time or full time; whether weekly,        fortnightly or monthly, we can take care of all your payroll needs and requirements.            A few facts                        Payroll needs to be reported to HMRC each time someone          gets paid, Ma’Leon Accountancy Services Limited will ensure that this takes place including sending you:                                Payslips for each employee            HMRC payment details so that it can be matched up to your bookkeeping records            Any analysis reports that may be needed            Any other relevant documentation i.e. P 60’s, P45’s and any other applicable P’s                                              \tAny payment due to HMRC is payable by 22nd of the end of the quarter            if you’re a small employer, or 22nd of the following month if you’re a large employer                      Contact us                                    Independent Examination (for Charities only) –            An alternative acceptable form of external scrutiny for smaller charities.                                It is a legal requirement to prepare accounts together with a Trustees’            annual report when you are a registered charity.                                There are different levels of requirements for different sizes of charities,            however, all charities must file their accounts and reports within 10 months of the year-end date.                        A few facts                                                              If income is below £10,000 then an annual update to the Charity Commission is required                                                  Above £10,000 but less than £25,000 an external scrutiny will not need to                  be completed however, the Trustees can opt to have this done                                                  If your charity is more than £25,000 but not exceeding £1,000,000 there is then a duty to file                  the annual accounts and Trustees report online and have the accounts independently examined                                                  An audit will be needed if the income exceeds £1,000,000                  and if both gross assets (before liabilities) exceed £3.26 million and gross income exceed £250,000                                                                  Ma’Leon Accountancy Services Limited will examine your accounting records in line with the process set out by            the Charity Commission. We will write a report that provides details of the result of the examination that will need to be published alongside your accounts.                                        In essence this type of scrutiny is to maintain public confidence that the charity is being              directed and controlled efficiently and been reviewed by a qualified and efficient company.
